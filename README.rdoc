= incomplete_date

This plugin allows a Rails application to store and manage incomplete date data,
which is very common in historical archives, particularly in genealogy.

== Usage

Declare columns in the database, preferably with the expected attribute name
prefixed, for instance with 'raw_'. For example, for an attribute named
+birth_date+ we could declare a column named +raw_birth_date+ or alternatively
+internal_birth_date+. The type of these columns must be +:integer+.

Then in the models, to have the virtual attributes returning and accepting
values of type +IncompleteDate+ declare the following:

  incomplete_date_attrs :birth_date, :death_date, :prefix => 'raw'

The default prefix is 'raw' so we do not need to declare it, unless we used
another prefix for the columns.

Alternatively, if there's no regular relation between the column name and the
expected attribute name, use the following way:

  incomplete_date_attr :attr_name, :raw_column_name

Note that in this last example we used the singular method call (finished in
+attr+ instead of +attrs+). In this case we pass the attribute
name we want, followed by the real column name found in the database.

== Installation

From your rails app directory do the following:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/gnapse/incomplete_date.git

Alternatively, if you are tracking your own project with git and you want to have this plugin as a git submodule,
instead of redundantly tracking this plugin's source code in your own repo, you can install it this way instead:

  git submodule add git://github.com/gnapse/incomplete_date.git vendor/plugins/incomplete_date/
